# Mobile Improvements

## Product Detail Page
- Added a sticky "Add to Quote" bar at the bottom of the screen on mobile devices.
- This ensures the primary call-to-action is always visible, improving user experience and potential conversion rates.
- Adjusted page padding to prevent content from being obscured by the sticky bar.
- Verified 3D viewer and product info stacking order.

## Breadcrumbs
- Added `flex-wrap` to the breadcrumbs navigation to prevent horizontal overflow on small screens with long product names.

## Home Page
- Added `PerformanceMetrics` section which is fully responsive.
- Verified `Hero` section and other components scale correctly on mobile.

## General
- Audited all pages for mobile responsiveness.
- `ProductCard` uses responsive padding and font sizes.
- `ComparisonBar` adapts to mobile by showing a summary instead of full product cards.
